# Admission-portal
The admission portal has been developed using Node.js and Express.js for the server-side, and MongoDB as the database management system.
This technology stack provides a scalable, efficient, and flexible solution for managing the admission process. Node.js allows for non-blocking I/O, making it ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously, while Express.js provides a simple and flexible framework for building web applications. MongoDB's document-oriented database structure enables flexible schema design and easy querying of data. Overall, this technology stack offers a powerful and modern solution for building a robust and user-friendly admission portal.
